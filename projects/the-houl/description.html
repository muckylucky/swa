The roof finish is pre-weathered grey standing seam zinc. Windows and external doors are triple glazed high performance timber, painted grey. All insulation levels are to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house">Passiv Haus</a> standards.</p>		<p>The slope of the roof of the main living accommodation follows the slope of the hillside, with the rear roof meeting the main roof at a shallower angle to allow morning sunlight to penetrate the centre of the house.</p>		<p>The entrance to the house is sited on the north east side of the house under the cover of the roof to provide shelter from the prevailing wind. The principal rooms are situated along the contour of the site to enjoy the views across the valley to the west. The ancillary spaces are generally to the rear.</p>		<p>The house is net ʻzero carbonʼ by using very high levels of insulation, minimising air infiltration heating using an air source heat pump with a ʻwhole house heat recovery ventilation systemʼ, and generating electricity using a wind turbine and solar PV panels.</p>

<h1>The Brae, Rhonehouse</h1><p>Our clients required an extension to the rear of the existing house to provide a connection to the existing south facing garden, and a new welcoming entrance.  </p><p>The garden was at a higher level than the ground level of the house so the new principal living room is raised up to the garden level while the new dining room extension visually connects the kitchen to the garden.</p><p>The internal accommodation was rearranged to principally address the garden side and provide four bedrooms.  A new study was created at the garden level in the transition space between new and existing.</p>
